While logged into my $WORK directory on TACC I can use Agave to upload directory to my Cyverse DataStore.

`files-upload -V -F AS_ex.map -S data.iplantcollaborative.org dhbrand/AlphaSim`
```
    -V means very Verbose output and is generally not required but included for this example
    -F is the name of the file or directory to be uploaded
    -S is the destination; data.iplantcollaborative.org directs to the Cyverse DataStore and from there its just username/directory
```
You can also see what files are listed in a directory easily.

`files-list -S data.iplantcollaborative.org dhbrand/AlphaSim`
```
    -S is the name of the directory you are looking in on Cyverse
```
Transferring from TACC $WORK directory to Cyverse DataStore from my local machine

`files-import -v -U agave://tacc-stampede2-dhbrand/getFiles.sh dhbrand/Validate`

Transferring from Cyverse DataStore to TACC $WORK directory from my local machine
